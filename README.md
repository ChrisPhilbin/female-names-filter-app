# Female Names Filter App

My organization routinely hosts thought leadership events specifically geared towards women in HR, Payroll, Finance, and C-suite level positions. Currently, our Salesforce instance does not make consistent use of the salutation field and this is a time consuming process to filter by female names only.

I created an Angular app used to take an export from a production Salesforce instance and filter prospects so only female prospects remain.

App can be utilized by 170+ Business Development Representatives, saving roughly 500 hours of labor hours annually totaling over $20,000 in labor costs.
